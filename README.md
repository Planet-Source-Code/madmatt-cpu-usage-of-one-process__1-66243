### Description

Hello everybody,

this is my first source code here, i hope you will enjoy it ;-)

This source code list the processes running on you're computer and list their individual CPU usage.

I mean that for each process, you get his % of processor time, exactly like in the windows task manager.
 
### More Info
 
This code uses the PDH.dll library and the performance counters, the cpu usage is not the only information you can get with my code, but i took this exemple because this is a frequently asked question in forums and it may interest some people.

I hope you'll find this helpfull.
